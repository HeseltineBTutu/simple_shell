**Ode to C**

Oh, C, you powerful and elegant tongue,
You've been the bedrock on which so much has been done.
From operating systems to games and apps,
Your versatility is unmatched, your influence never snaps.

With your pointers and structs, your loops and arrays,
You give us the power to build anything we can craze.
Your concise syntax and low-level control,
Make you the perfect language for programmers bold.

But C, you can be a fickle mistress,
Your memory management can be quite tricky.
One careless mistake, and your program will crash,
Leaving you debugging, feeling quite rash.

Yet despite your challenges, we love you still,
For you give us the power to create at will.
So here's to you, C, our trusty old friend,
May your reign as the king of programming never end.
